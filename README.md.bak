# Project Overivew
The purpose of this project was to create a user-friendly webpage that allows users to easily filter through UFO sighting data. 
Due to the large volume of data available for UFO sightings, it can be difficult to view in aggreggate. The webpage was designed with a filter that allows users to fitler based on the following criteria:
 - Date
 - City
 - State
 - Country
 - Shape

The goal was to assist users in finding the UFO sighting data they are looking for!

# Results
When a user first opens the site, they will be taken to the main page that will display all of the UFO sighting data.
